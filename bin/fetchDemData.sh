# /opt/opengeofiction/ogf-server-scripts/bin/fetchDemData.sh <style> [zone ...]
#
# With no zones named, the zones to load are whatever dem/active-zones.txt says.
# That list is about rendering, not publishing: a zone can be published and
# downloadable and still be left out of it, so what is on the server is not the
# same question as what belongs on the map. Naming zones does just those, and
# skips the removal pass.
#
# Downloads only happen when the published copy is newer, and the VRT and the
# database are only rebuilt when something has actually changed.
#
# The zones which changed are left in dem/changed-zones as
# "<zone> <minlon> <minlat> <maxlon> <maxlat>", for renderDemZones.sh. The
# footprint is recorded here rather than derived there because a zone which has
# been removed no longer has a raster to derive it from, and its tiles are
# exactly the ones which have to be redrawn.
#
# A style can also ask for the coarse ladder Danu publishes beside the shade -
# relief-5000, relief-500, hillshade-5000, hillshade-1000, hillshade-500 - by
# naming the bands in its dem/ladder, one a line. Each is fetched per zone like
# the shade, the hillshades put through the same ramp, and mosaicked as
# dem/<band>.vrt. ttopo draws z1-8 from them; cyclogf has no ladder file.
#
# Note the data is shared, not per style: one dem directory and one contours
# database, whatever %i says. Only enable the timer for one style.
