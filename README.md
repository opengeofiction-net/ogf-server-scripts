# ogf-server-scripts

Scripts, systemd units and configuration for running [OpenGeofiction](https://opengeofiction.net).
Checked out on each server at `/opt/opengeofiction/ogf-server-scripts` and run
from there, mostly by the systemd units in `etc/systemd/system`.

Not a Perl distribution, despite the history: there is nothing to install and no
`Makefile.PL`. Clone it, point the units at it, and make sure the Perl and
Python modules the scripts use are present.

The infrastructure itself is documented separately, in the admin wiki, built
from the [docs](https://git.opengeofiction.net/OpenGeofiction/docs-internal)
repository.

## What is here

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/*.sh` | backups, Overpass, tile rendering and replication, site up and down |
| `bin/*.pl` | Overpass-driven jobs - coastline, territory polygons, continents, user lists, activity - and log analysis |
| `bin/fetchDemData.sh`, `bin/renderDemZones.sh`, `bin/demExpireTiles.py` | the consuming half of the elevation process: fetch what Danu published, load it, expire the tiles it changed |
| `lib/OGF/` | the Perl the above share: an OSM data model, Overpass, geometry |
| `etc/systemd/system/` | the units which run all of it |
| `etc/` | PostgreSQL tuning, Apache configuration, render style patches |

## Configuration

Some Perl scripts read `ogftools.conf`, from the working directory,
`$HOME/.ogf/ogftools.conf` or `/etc/ogftools.conf`. Copy
`ogftools.sample.conf` and edit it.

The Overpass-driven scripts also want `$HOME/.osmtoolsrc` for the API user,
password and url.

## The elevation process

The elevation pipeline lives in [danu](https://github.com/opengeofiction-net/danu)
and is installed from the `danu-server` package. It builds the DEM from the
contour squares mappers draw and publishes the rasters and contour extracts.

What stays here is the consuming half, which runs on the tile servers and knows
nothing about how the rasters were made:

    fetchDemData.sh <style> [zone ...]   # fetch what Danu published and load it
    renderDemZones.sh <style>            # expire the tiles over what changed

The interface between the two is a published directory and a manifest:
`active-zones.txt`, `<zone>/hillshade-<zfactor>.tif` and
`<zone>/contours-<zone>.osm.pbf` under `data.opengeofiction.net/dem`. Nothing is
imported across; changing one of those three is changing another repository's
input.

See *Admin:Elevation process* in the wiki for what it produces and why, and
*Admin:Coastline process* for the sea level data it depends on.

## History

This began as a Perl distribution written by Thilo Stapff for turning
hand-drawn contours into elevation tiles, and grew the operational scripts
later. It descends from
[opengeofiction/ogf-server-scripts](https://github.com/opengeofiction/ogf-server-scripts),
which is where that work was published and which has been dormant since
November 2024. Everything here is downstream of it, and the link is recorded
in prose because a repository's own history does not say so once it stands on
its own.

Three things happened in 2026. In August the terrain half was replaced by a
GDAL pipeline and the Perl behind it removed; it remains at the tag
`thilo-dem-process`, under the name the repository had then, and what it could
do is written up in *Admin:Elevation process* - rather more than contour
conversion, as it turns out. In September the elevation pipeline moved out
altogether to [danu](https://github.com/opengeofiction-net/danu), which owns it
end to end and leaves only the consuming half here. And the repository was
renamed from `ogf-server-scripts` to `ogf-server-scripts`, to say what it is
rather than what it was.
